# EpicStaff: Open-Source Multi-Agent Orchestration Platform

### AI Agents Without The Frustration. Build Production-Grade Agentic Systems with Visual Workflows and Full Backend Control.

EpicStaff is an open-source **production-grade platform** for building **multi-agent AI systems** with maximum flexibility and minimum friction. We bridge the gap between no-code simplicity and developer centric power, offering a unified **custom AI agent workflow platform**.

Create intelligent agents that operate with high performance, retain memory across complex tasks and reason based on injected knowledge. Our **asynchronous, low-latency AI orchestration engine** built on **FastAPI** ensures your AI workflows are both fast and scalable.

## A Dual-Approach Platform for Modern Teams

We built EpicStaff to serve everyone involved in building AI-powered solutions, from business analysts to senior developers.

### üîπ For Business Teams & No-Code Users: Visual AI Project Builder

Create powerful, multitasking AI agents through our intuitive **visual AI workflow builder**. Use a node-based **graphic interface** to connect pre-built blocks for text analysis, response generation, file management, CRM integration and more. Go from idea to a functional AI agent **without writing a single line of code**.

### üîπ For Developers: A High-Performance FastAPI Multi-Agent Backend

Get full control with a modular transparent **open-source FastAPI backend**. Dive deep into our **event-driven architecture** to customize orchestration logic define **fine-grained task control** and integrate custom Python tools seamlessly. No black boxes, no magic just a clean extensible **RESTful agent orchestration** framework that respects your need for control.

**Whether you're experimenting, prototyping or deploying to production EpicStaff adapts to you:**
* Use the **drag-and-drop visual interface** when speed is key.
* Dive into the **Python backend** when custom logic is required.
* Combine both approaches seamlessly in a single project.

> We hide the complexity, not the logic.
